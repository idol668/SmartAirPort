Project Tasks
-------------

T5. UI simulation:
	1. Create the scenarios .
	2. Fine tuning the animation 
	3. Code still needs to be organized and documanted .

T6. Add missing guarantees about:
	1. How to handle differently the planes according to their types in emergancy landings (we still didn't 		decide if we will add it or not).





Delivered in Sprint 3
---------------------

T1. Safety guarantees and assumptions for the emergencylanding are added.
T2. We added a response pattern gurantee so that the airport( and more specifically the plane) will remain in the emergency state until a rescue team will arrive.
T3. We added gurantees that won't allow any plane to land or takeoff while the airport in an emergency state. 
T4. Simulation running, and responsive. Users can now use the panel and add their own inputs to the simulation.
T5. In the simulation the emergency landing is working.
T6.  We made some fine tuning and improvments in the landing and take off animations to make it more clear for the users.
T7. We added some new classes and moved methods to there to make the code more readable and organized.
