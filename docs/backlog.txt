Project Tasks
-------------

T5. UI simulation:
	1. Create an Intercative manual mode
	2. Create Scenarios simulation
	3. Handle the different gurantees from the spectra specifcation for the emergancy landing
	4. .Fine tune  the animations.

T6. Add missing guarantees about:
	1. Emergancy landings
	2. How to handle differently the planes according to their types in emergancy landings





Delivered in Sprint 2
---------------------

T1. Safety guarantees and assumptions about the slippery runway and mechinical problem features
T2. We added a response pattern gurantees to say that whenver a slippery runway or mechinical problem occures it will remain in this state until cleaning/repair truck comes to fix it.
T3. Simulation running (but still not interctive, the menu panel is set but still not interactive 
T4. In the simulation the slippery runway and mechinical problem features are already working.
T5. Improved the appreance of the simulation (minor deatails).
