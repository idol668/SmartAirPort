Assumptions
-----------

1. Whenever aircraft are coming they have to stay in the waiting area until they are allowed to land or departure
2.  Conistent mechinical problem - whenver there is a mechinical problem that is still not handled, the plane will remain in the same state, hence it will still have a mechinical problem.
3.  Conistent slippery runway - whenver there is a slippery runway that is still not handled, the runway will remain in the same state, hence it will still remain slippery .
4. If repair truck arrives when there is a mechinical problem in the next state the mechinical problem is fixed.
5. If clean truck arrives when there is a slippery runway in the next state the slippery runway is fixed.
6. There are no adjcent runways that are dirty at the same time.

Guarantees
----------

1. In case an aircraft is waiting for landing or departure it will evenutally get the permmision to land or take off.
2. In each runway we allow only for one way traffic, hence each runway will allow only a plane landing or takingoff at the same time.
3. A repair truck will be sent only if aircraft exists.
4. If there is no mechinical problem the system won't send a repair truck.
5. In case there is a mechnical problem eventually a repair truck will be sent to handle the issue.
6. If a plane has a mechinical problem, it's not allowed to execute a takeoff.
7. If there is no slippery runway the system won't send a clean truck.
8. In case there is a slippery runway eventually a clean truck will be sent to handle the issue
9. If the runway[i] is slippery takeoffs and landings on this runway won't be allowed (until the issue if fixed).
